    <h1 id="The-beginning-of-self-exploration"><a href="#The-beginning-of-self-exploration" class="headerlink" title="The beginning of self-exploration"></a>The beginning of self-exploration</h1><p>Ten years passed in a blink of an eye. Looking back on my career, I can’t help but feel emotional. In 2012, when I was
    still a sophomore in high school, I made a decision that changed the trajectory of my life—dropping out of school. This
    decision did not stem from a yearning for a specific field, but from dissatisfaction with the education system at that
    time and a desire for self-realization.</p>
<p>The rebelliousness of adolescence coupled with my distaste for cramming education made me decide to enter society early,
learn practical skills, and share the burden for my family. In the six months after I dropped out of school, I worked in
a restaurant, from serving as a waiter to a waiter and then to a fruit plate maker. I experienced three different
positions in a short period of time. This experience gave me a preliminary understanding of the workings of the
workplace and also developed my ability to learn and adapt quickly.</p>
<p>However, the inner restlessness did not subside. With a longing for the unknown, I followed three friends from the
restaurant to travel north. During one month in Beijing, I tried two jobs: one week in fire control and one week in
sporting goods sales. Although these two jobs were short-lived, they made me deeply realize that the real value of life
does not lie in comfort, but in finding a career that can stimulate your passion.</p>
<p>I returned to my hometown with confusion about the future and "The Road Less Traveled" given to me by my brother. This
book had a profound impact on me. It not only helped me understand the importance of subjective initiative, but also
made me start thinking about how to take charge of my own life.</p>
<p>It was at this time, under the guidance of my older brother, that I was introduced to online learning platforms and
began to understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This chance encounter became the starting point for me to
step into the IT industry.</p>
<p>From then on, I started my journey of self-study. Every line of code is my expectation for the future, and every project
is a testimony of my pursuit of excellence. I gradually discovered that programming is not just a job, but an art that
perfectly combines logic, creativity and beauty. This knowledge inspired my inner pursuit of perfection and became the
driving force for me to keep moving forward.</p>
<p>This experience of self-exploration and growth not only laid my technical foundation, but also cultivated my persistent
learning ability and work attitude towards excellence. They are like guiding lights, illuminating my career path in the
next ten years. They also make me understand that the value of life does not lie in the starting point, but in the
courage and perseverance to constantly surpass oneself.</p>
<p>Looking back on this turning point, I am very grateful. It is these seemingly tortuous experiences that have shaped me
into who I am today. They taught me to try and not be afraid to fail, and they taught me the importance of finding what
I really love. This experience became the cornerstone of my career and guided me to break through and find my niche in
the IT industry over the next decade.</p>
<h2 id="Explore-and-grow"><a href="#Explore-and-grow" class="headerlink" title="Explore and grow"></a>Explore and grow</h2><p>In March 2014, I got my first job. Although Beijing Wogou Technology Co., Ltd. is not large, it has opened the door to
my workplace. Here, I'm mainly responsible for developing router-based web systems, which are the kind of login pages
that pop up when you connect to WiFi at an airport or café. Although this job only lasted for half a year, it allowed me
to put into practice what I had learned on my own for the first time, and it also gave me a deep understanding of the
wide range of technology applications.</p>
<p>However, the real turning point came in October 2014. I joined a P2C company, Antou Rong (Beijing) Ai Investment Network
Technology Co., Ltd. Here, my technical skills are like riding a rocket, and I am growing by leaps and bounds. From the
initial front-end cut-out, to the gradual involvement in back-end development, to participating in the architectural
design of complex functions, my role has continued to expand, and my capabilities have continued to improve.</p>
<p>This experience made me deeply realize that the beauty of technology lies not only in its surface neatness, but also in
its inner logic and efficiency. I began to pursue the elegance and efficiency of the code, striving to achieve a
near-perfect state for every function and every module. This pursuit not only improved my technical level, but also won
the recognition of my leaders and colleagues, opening up a broader space for my career development.</p>
<p>During my two years at this company, I worked on many challenging projects. What I am most proud of is the design and
development of a system to prevent brute force cracking, protecting the account security of more than 5 million users.
Another unforgettable experience was writing back-end scripts to issue vouchers to these users. This not only exercised
my technical skills, but also gave me a deep understanding of the complexity of large-scale system operations.</p>
<p>This experience taught me that a true technical master must not only have solid coding skills, but also have the wisdom
to solve practical problems. It inspired my passion for continuous learning and innovation and laid a solid foundation
for my future career development.</p>
<h2 id="From-front-end-engineer-to-architect"><a href="#From-front-end-engineer-to-architect" class="headerlink" title="From front-end engineer to architect"></a>From front-end engineer to architect</h2><p>In December 2016, my career reached an important turning point. I joined Beijing Hengshi Technology Co., Ltd., an
emerging company that was just established two months ago. As the company's first front-end development engineer, I
shoulder the heavy responsibility of building the entire front-end system. This challenge is both exciting and
stressful, but my full-stack development experience and relentless pursuit of perfection give me the confidence to meet
this challenge.</p>
<p>Our flagship product is an embedded BI (Business Intelligence) tool that focuses on embedded use cases. Building such a
complex system from scratch requires comprehensive technical reserves and deep architecture design capabilities. I chose
React Family Bucket as my front-end tech stack, not only because of its power, but also because it helps me achieve
modularity and maintainability of my code, which is in line with my pursuit of code aesthetics.</p>
<p>In the process, I continue to challenge myself and push the boundaries of front-end development further. I delved into
key areas such as performance optimization, state management, and component design, striving to achieve the best in
every detail.</p>
<p>My perfectionism was on full display at this stage. I strive to achieve the highest standards in the design of every
component and the implementation of every function. What I pursue is not only the cleanliness and efficiency of the
code, but also the elegance and scalability of the entire system. This pursuit drives me to continuously learn new
technologies, explore best practices, and ultimately make our products the best in the industry.</p>
<p>During this process, I also deeply realized that true full-stack development is not only about mastering front-end and
back-end technologies, but more importantly, having global thinking and being able to think about problems from multiple
dimensions such as products, users, and technology. This way of thinking allowed me to always find the optimal solution
when solving complex problems, and also laid the foundation for my later growth as an architect.</p>
<p>Looking back on this journey of full-stack development, I feel a lot of emotion. It not only exercised my technical
skills, but also cultivated my way of thinking in solving problems. This experience made me understand that the true
meaning of technology does not lie in how many frameworks or languages ​​you master, but in how to use these tools to
create value and achieve a near-perfect user experience. This knowledge has become the driving force for me to keep
moving forward.</p>
<p>During the eight years at Beijing Hengshi Technology Co., Ltd., I experienced a transformation from a front-end engineer
to a senior architect. The journey has been challenging and rewarding. As a veteran employee of the company, I have
witnessed the company's growth, and in the process I have continued to break through myself and reach new heights in my
career.</p>
<p>Our products are constantly evolving. From the initial basic functions to supporting complex data analysis and
visualization, every iteration is a test of my technical ability. I have always maintained the pursuit of perfection.
Whether it is the pixel-level restoration of the front-end interface or the rigor of logic, I strive to achieve the
ultimate. This pursuit is not only reflected at the code level, but also reflected in the user experience of the entire
product.</p>
<p>As a senior architect, my responsibilities go far beyond writing code. I need to think about the development direction
of the product from a higher level and design a system architecture that can support future growth. This requires me to
not only have a solid technical foundation, but also have excellent communication skills. I know that an excellent
architecture must not only be technologically advanced, but also meet business needs and be able to respond quickly to
market changes.</p>
<p>Along the way, my role has expanded. I am no longer just a technical implementer, but also a leader in the company's
technical direction. I take the lead in learning and introducing new technologies, organize technology sharing meetings,
and encourage team members to continuously improve themselves. My enthusiasm and professional attitude infected the
colleagues around me and promoted a positive learning atmosphere for the entire technical team.</p>
<p>Problem solving is one of the skills I am most proud of. In these eight years, I have encountered countless difficult
technical problems, from performance bottlenecks to security vulnerabilities, from architecture reconstruction to new
feature development. Every time, I can calmly analyze, find the root of the problem, and come up with effective
solutions. This ability not only earned me the trust of my colleagues, but also allowed me to become a key person in the
company who promotes collaboration among various teams.</p>
<p>I look back on this experience with great pride. I not only witnessed the growth of a product from scratch, but also
personally experienced my own growth from an ordinary front-end engineer to a senior architect who affects the company's
technical direction. Throughout this process, my perfectionism has always been my driving force. Every code refactoring
and every architectural optimization is a relentless pursuit of beauty.</p>
<p>However, I know that the world of technology never ends. Even today, I still maintain a strong curiosity and desire to
learn. I believe that only by continuous learning and innovation can we remain competitive in this rapidly changing
industry. This belief will continue to guide me further on the road of technology.</p>
<h2 id="Self-driving-force-and-continuous-learning"><a href="#Self-driving-force-and-continuous-learning" class="headerlink" title="Self-driving force and continuous learning"></a>Self-driving force and continuous learning</h2><p>Looking back on my ten-year career, I feel deeply proud and grateful. From a high school dropout to a senior architect
today, the journey has been filled with challenges and great rewards.</p>
<p>What I am most proud of is not the achievements I have made, but the drive that underpins them. It is this inner
motivation that enables me to continue to climb new heights in the technical field even without a high degree of
education. My experience proves that in this rapidly developing industry, what really matters is not your academic
qualifications, but your ability to learn and solve problems.</p>
<p>My perfectionism has persisted throughout my career. From the initial pursuit of clean code, to the subsequent
meticulous refinement of system architecture, and now to the ultimate pursuit of product user experience, this
persistence in beauty and efficiency has always been the core driving force for me to move forward. It is not only
reflected in my work, but also affects my attitude towards life. Just like after I dropped out of school, I followed my
father to work on a construction site and experienced work such as resisting steel bars and electric welding. These
experiences made me cherish my current job even more and kept me open and curious about various challenges in life.</p>
<p>Today, with the rapid development of technology, maintaining enthusiasm and curiosity for learning is more important
than ever. Only by maintaining a lifelong learning attitude can we remain invincible in this industry full of
opportunities and challenges.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the future, I am full of expectations. The world of technology never ends, and emerging technologies
such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things are changing the way we live and work. As a tech
guy, I couldn't be more excited. I will continue to maintain my curiosity and enthusiasm for learning, continue to
explore new technical areas, and create more value for users.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also hope to pass on my experience and enthusiasm to more young people. Whether within the company
or with the broader technology community, I am willing to share my story to encourage more people to believe in
themselves and pursue their dreams.</p>
<p>Ten years passed with the snap of a finger. Looking back, I have no regrets. This experience taught me that success does
not depend on where you start, but on how you stick to your beliefs, keep learning, and keep improving. The road ahead
is still long, but I am ready to meet the challenges of the next decade with fuller enthusiasm and a more open mind. The
world of technology is changing rapidly, but my pursuit of perfection and thirst for knowledge will never change.</p>
<p>If you are reading this, I can clearly state that this text is from AI! All I can say is that my writing skills have not
improved over the years, and I couldn't express this directly on my own, but the advent of AI has given me the
opportunity to put my experiences and insights into words. Thanks to AI, I am able to record this challenging and
rewarding career in this way.</p>
